# Introduction to React

<p><code>ReactJS</code> is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application.A ReactJS application is made up of multiple components, each component responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML code. The components are the heart of all React applications. These Components can be nested with other components to allow complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. ReactJS uses virtual DOM based mechanism to fill data in HTML DOM.</p>

<p>To create <code>React app</code>, we write React components that correspond to various elements. We organize these components inside higher level components which define the application structure. For example, we take a form that consists of many elements like input fields, labels, or buttons. We can write each element of the form as React components, and then we combine it into a higher-level component, i.e., the form component itself. The form components would specify the structure of the form along with elements inside of it.</p>

#### React uses virtual DOM based mechanism to fill data in HTML DOM. The virtual DOM works fast as it only changes individual DOM elements instead of reloading complete DOM every time.

# React Environment Setup

We will learn how to set up an environment for the successful development of ReactJS application.

## Pre-requisite for ReactJS

1. NodeJS and NPM
2. React and React DOM

## Ways to install ReactJS

1. Using the npm command

2. Using the create-react-app command

   Note: We are using the second way of installing and creating the React JS Application. And before start creating the React App, We have listed out some commands to know the version of the Node and NPM.

   

   ```react
   // To find the version of Node and NPM
    node -v // shows the current installed version of node
    npm -v  // shows the 
   ```
